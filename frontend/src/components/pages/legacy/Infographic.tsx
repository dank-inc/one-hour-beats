        <h3>prepare your body</h3>
        <p>
          prepare yourself for a cascade of creative ideas, the best way to

        <h3>feel the creative explosion</h3>
        <p>
          fire up your recording software, your handheld recorder, or even
          record a voice memo, whatever gets the job done, start writing,
          recording, arranging, and don't stop until the clock runs out!
        </p>
      </p>
      <p>
        <h3>submit your masterpiece</h3>
        <p>
          You will have 20 minutes to upload your entry to the challenge, listen
          to the entries of other people and cast your votes, those with the
          most ðŸ”¥ wins! But in the end, it's not about winning, it's about{' '}
          <i>friendship</i>

      </p>
      <p>
        <h3>reflect and repeat</h3>
        <p>

          you can create your own challenge!
