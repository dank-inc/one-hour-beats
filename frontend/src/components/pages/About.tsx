      <p>
        Once upon a time, in the early demoscene years, in the days of the
        trackers there existed a compo.
      </p>
      <p>This compo was called OHC. It stood for "one hour competition"</p>
      <p>
        Sadly the modern DAW has taken much from the demoscene days, Including
        our beloved One Hour Compo.
      </p>
      <p>But that all changes here, today!</p>

        Elijah Lucian started "one hour beating" in 2010, and found it to be a
        great way to create a jump-off point for a song!
