# ONE HOUR BEATS (again)

## this is the new one hour beats project.

# TODO before release

- get all initial state
- plug in a database
- add password hashing (bcrypt)
- deploy

### MVP - three pages:

Home Page

- [*] add a home page with a list of active jams
- [*] add a "Create Jam" page where anybody can create a jam - anybody can hit the start button

Jam View Page

- [*] add a "Jam View" page where people can see a timer and the challenge
- [*] add a "Submit Jam" where people can paste their soundcloud
  links etc.

- [*] add voting!
- User accounts.
- Add voting

### Milestone 1 - stuff:

- add jam sorting
- sort jams by most recent or most active.
- expire jams not started in 1 day
- vote to start jam?
- jam expires maybe 1 day after opening it?
- profile page.
- voting time limit. maybe submission count \* 10 minutes.

### Milestone 2:

- push notifiactions
- join jam button
- privtate / password protected jams
- Optional file upload (for pro users because hosting costs real dinero.)

# Ideas:

- sample packs
- maybe some cool indicator that a jam is starting soon to prompt people to get into the jam.
- allow jam creator or 50% vote to extend the jam time.

### achievements:

- Super Creator: created number of successful jams (created & had more than 3 people submit and vote and declare a winner.)
- JamPocalypse: N entries made
- Twitch & Jam: linked N streams to OHC

### delayed challenges!

- allow a time window and a time limit.
- users will have their own local jam timer.
- example: jam is for 24 hours, people can join along that time and partake with their own personal timer.

## other rules to implement

- get a vote token by submitting an entry
- can't start a jam unless 3 people say 'go'
