# ONE HOUR BEATS (again)

## this is the new one hour beats project.

### MVP - three pages:

Home Page

- [ ] add a home page with a list of active jams
      Create Jam
- [*] add a "Create Jam" page where anybody can create an anonymus jam - anybody can hit the start button

Jam View Page

- [*] add a "Jam View" page where people can see a timer and the challenge
- [ ] add a "Submit Jam" where people can paste their soundcloud
      links etc.
- [ ] expire jams not started in 1 day
- [*] add voting!

### Milestone 1 - user accounts:

- User accounts.
- Add voting
- profile page.

### Milestone 2:

- join jam button
- Optional file upload (for pro users because hosting costs real dinero.)

# Ideas:

- sample packs

achievements:

- created number of successful jams (created & had more than 3 people submit and vote and declare a winner.)

## other rules to implement

- get a vote token by submitting an entry
- can't start a jam unless 3 people say 'go'
